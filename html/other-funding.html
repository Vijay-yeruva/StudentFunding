                        conferred bachelor's degree or equivalent before the start of the grant.        In the creative and performing

                        creative and performing arts, four years of professional training and/or experience meets the basic eligibility 
                        requirement.    Applicants must be in good health. Grantees will be required to submit a satisfactory Medical 
                        Certificate from a physician.    Applicants must have sufficient proficiency in the written and spoken language 
                        of the host country sufficient to communicate with the people and to carry out the proposed study/research. 
                        This is especially important for projects in the social sciences and the humanities.    Applicants may hold a 
                        J.D. at the time of application.    Doctors of Medicine may receive grants for advanced academic study, but 
                        not for internships or residencies. Scholars with an M.D. degree who have completed their formal postgraduate

                        should apply to the Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program. Grants shall not authorize activity for which a license 
                        to practice medicine or nursing is required. The Fulbright Program cannot authorize proposals for medical 
                        research that involves clinical training, patient care or patient contact.    Preferred Qualifications    
                        Strong preference in the Fulbright U.S. Student Program is for those who have not previously held a Fulbright 
                        grant. For the 2020-2021 competition, recipients of grants in 2017-2018, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020 will be at a 
                        competitive disadvantage, but are still eligible to apply, provided they continue to meet all other eligibility 
                        requirements.    Preference will be given to applicants whose higher education was undertaken primarily at 
                        educational institutions in the United States. Foreign study during the junior year or other periods of 
                        undergraduate study that are inte­gral parts of the curricula of American institutions will not be considered a 
                        disadvantage.    Candidates who have not resided or studied in the country to which they are applying for more 
                        than six months, not counting undergraduate study abroad, are preferred. Duty abroad in the Armed Forces of the 
                        United States is not considered disqualifying within the meaning of this section.    Candidates who have served 
                        in the Armed Forces of the United States will be given preference, provided their qualifications are approximately 
                        equivalent to those of other candidates.    For most programs, applicants who have had extensive, recent previous 
                        foreign experience in the host country are at a competitive disadvantage but are still eligible to apply.
